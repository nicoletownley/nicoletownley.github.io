Please enjoy my portfolio.

On the page you will find my name. The name contains a link to my resume.

There are also several links under Portfolio. By following the links, you will be taken to the actual project where you can have an user interface experience. If you would like to review the code for the projects, please follow the links given when you click the Git icon under Code.

There are a few blurbs about me, which gets to the heart of who I am. Hopefully, my mind, body, and soul will be expressed through my work.
